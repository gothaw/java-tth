In my opinion, the main differences between regular application development and web application development are:

Platform: Regular application development involves creating software applications that are installed on a user's computer or device, while web application development involves creating software applications that are accessed through a web browser.

Architecture: Regular applications are typically standalone, whereas web applications are usually built using a client-server architecture, where the client (the user's web browser) communicates with a server that processes the user's requests and returns the appropriate responses.

Development tools: Regular application development often involves using programming languages and tools specific to the operating system or platform, while web application development typically involves using web-specific technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.

Deployment: Regular applications are typically distributed through a variety of methods, such as physical media or online app stores, while web applications are usually deployed on web servers that are accessible over the internet.

Security: Web applications must be designed with security in mind, since they are exposed to the internet and can be accessed by potentially malicious users. This requires implementing various security measures like authentication, encryption, and input validation, which may not be as critical in regular application development.

Overall, web application development presents unique challenges and considerations that are not present in regular application development, such as designing for the web platform, optimizing for different browsers and devices, and ensuring security and scalability.
